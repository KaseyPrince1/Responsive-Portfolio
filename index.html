                <p>Hi there! My name is Kasey, but most of my closest friends refer to me as 'KP', 'KitKatKase' or 'NASA's Mum' (NASA, fur baby goldendoodle).
                I am a 23 year old student at the University of Utah. I am very eager to graduate spring 2020 with a degree in Psychology & Chinese! 
                I love traveling, learning, working, hot yoga and coffee!</p>
